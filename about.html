     <p class="paragraph1"> My name is Tavi! I am 18 years old Romanian boy. I am studying at KEA School of Design and Technology. I love to travel, to drive, to play guitar and other instruments and to take pictures. I will better start with how I decided to apply for Multimedia Design and Communication. I always wanted to do something different than my friends/kids of my age/people around me. I wanted to be different. So, by living in a small town, I was almost the only one who thought about studying in a different country. I decided to go in Denmark because I believe Denmark is the most civilized country in the European Union and I found the Multimedia Design and Communication programme on Kea website, and I really liked what I saw, and what I after found out about the programme. That's the small story behind my application. </p>
